# Bootstrap Practice
# Series of websites experimenting and learning to use Bootstrap 4

<h3>bootstrap.html</h3>
Utilizes a basic dark navigation bar with a search bar, grid layout system, tables with different styling, and a login form.  Experimented with how to use different media queries to adapt for diffent screen size layouts

<h3>modals.html</h3>
Learned how to activate spy scrolling with our navigation bar so that as we scroll down the page, the headers at the nav bar changes to match the content.  At the bottom of the page, I used popup modals on the click of a button, a toggle popover, and a tooltip.

<h3>jumbotron.html</h3>
This website plays around with jumbotrons, cards (with grid layout), progress bars with styling, and warning alerts.

<h3>bootstrapapp.html</h3>
A final website that utilizes many bootstrap features to display a sample app landing page.  It contains a navbar with spy scrolling activated and responsive links leading to content on the page.  A jumbotron with email for signup.  Includes a content area using Bootstrap's card features, and a footer with google play and app store logos.  I integrated fonts from font awesome.
